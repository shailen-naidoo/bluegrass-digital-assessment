# Bluegrass Digital Assessment

Hi reviewer, I trust you are well.

Sadly, due to incredibly limited time, I could not complete the [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/design/qCXQ5ipAdYvtkQ0DKyhYrT/Frontend-WEB?node-id=203-11148&t=qsjhNn1yTSlWUfcV-4) as required. I understand that I have not completed the assessment but I thought it would be a better to showcase my skills and experience in other areas beyond just the UI.

I spent some time implementing a bare-bones `service` and `models` pattern to isolate external dependencies such as network requests. This is a fairly straightforward implementation and should be a foundational pattern for every application. I also had setup a simple API using `json-server`.

## Setting up the environment for the application

1. You should have access to the repo if you are reading this.
2. Please clone the repo to your local machine
3. I am assuming you are using a Linux-based or MacOS machine
4. I am assuming you have [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed.

## Running the application

1. Run `source dev.sh` to install the Node.js version for the project
2. Run `npm i` to install the Node.js packages
3. Run `npm run api` to serve the backend API required by the frontend
4. Run `npm run dev` to serve the frontend in a separate terminal

## Running unit tests

1. Run `npm run test`

## How to test

1. Open the URL `http://localhost:3000` to view the frontend
2. Click the `Dashboard` button to view the dashboard page
3. You should see an aspect of the Figma design.

## Let's chat

I would love to chat to you about the approaches that I had taken and some of the decisions I made due to limited time.

Thank you for your time! :)
